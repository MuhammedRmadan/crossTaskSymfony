Please read these notes first :
-I couldnot bring the project to life using docker ..after hours of debugging i found that the problem was that i am windows user and i cant afford using my limited resources a lap with working ubunto OS with my personal lap.
-The VM image didnot preserve the state due to unknown error also.
-The solution i came up with is to establish a fresh of symfony project having the lasy version and transfer the business logic to it and then i accomplished the required task and uploaded the project on Github.
-To make the project work just clone from the repository https://github.com/MuhammedRmadan/crossTaskSymfony.git and then run composer install and symfony server:start.
-To run the unit tests on this version just type php "vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit".
-This is the endpoint to filter the cars using Postman http://localhost:8000/cars/index?limit=5&page=1&sort=c.id&direction=desc&search=black.
-I did the task with barely knowing the framework ..and i did it with the knowledge ie get from laravel ..and searching through the documentation.
